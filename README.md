## Description
This project was made from scratch, and was more involved than past projects. I first had to create my schema and seeds files, and then make the functions work when a prompt is selected. Once the coding was done, I did a walkthrough video to show the functionality. This is an employee tracker and database, where the user can view a deparment, roles, and employees, as well as add a department, role, employee, or update an employee.
